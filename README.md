# Pico
Raspbery Pi Pico code demonstrating USB serial communication. It's nothing fancy.
One files goes on the Pico (as main.py or run it from Thonny),
The other file -you guessed it- is ran on the host.

I'm using a Pimorini Pi Display in this demo, but the code can be used for anything really.

For more information see the comments in the Python and MicroPython file.

If you are on windows, be sure to check the serial post as in the code it's dev/ttyACM0 for a Linux machine.
